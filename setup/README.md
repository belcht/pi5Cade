# RetroPie-on-Raspberry-Pi-OS box hardening

System-level configuration that makes a Raspberry Pi 5 arcade box reliable for
RetroPie. Each file here is the exact, proven config from a reference
RetroPie-on-Raspberry-Pi-OS box.

> **You usually don't apply these by hand.** `picadeinstall.sh` (repo root)

> [docs/BUILD.md](../docs/BUILD.md). This file documents what each piece does and

Order doesn't matter, but do **persistent logging first** — if anything else
misbehaves, you'll then have logs that survive a reboot to diagnose it.

---

## 1. Persistent logging (`40-rpi-volatile-storage.conf`)

**Why:** Raspberry Pi OS ships `/usr/lib/systemd/journald.conf.d/40-rpi-volatile-storage.conf`
with `Storage=volatile` — the systemd journal lives in RAM and is **wiped on
every reboot**. That makes intermittent boot problems (no network, failed
service) impossible to diagnose after the fact. This drop-in (same filename, in
`/etc`, so it overrides the stock one) switches logs to persistent on disk.

```bash
sudo cp setup/40-rpi-volatile-storage.conf /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
journalctl --list-boots          # should accumulate >1 boot after a reboot
```

## 2. USB audio stable naming (`asound.conf` + `90-waveshare-usb-audio.rules`)

**Why:** A USB sound card has no fixed ALSA index — depending on boot/enumeration
order it can come up as card 0, 1, or 2, and anything addressing it as `hw:0`
breaks. The udev rule gives the card a **stable name** (`WaveshareUSB`) by
matching its USB VID:PID (`0c76:1203` — the JMTek/Waveshare "USB PnP Audio
Device"), regardless of port or index. `asound.conf` then points the ALSA
default at that **name**. `plug`+`dmix` lets multiple apps share the card.

> If your dongle is a different model, change the `idVendor`/`idProduct` in the
> rule (find them with `lsusb`).

```bash
sudo cp setup/90-waveshare-usb-audio.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo cp setup/asound.conf                  /etc/asound.conf
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=sound --action=add
cat /proc/asound/card0/id        # -> WaveshareUSB (whatever index it lands on)
aplay -D default /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav   # should play
```

RetroArch needs no card index — leave `audio_device = ""` so it follows the
ALSA default.

### 2a. Boot-time audio selector (`select-default-audio.{sh,service}`)

**Why:** there's no single "right" default output. The connected HDMI can be
card 0 **or** card 1 depending on which of the Pi's two HDMI ports you used (ALSA's
bare default is always card 0, so the *other* port gives silence), and a USB sound
card — great when present — won't always cold-enumerate (the JMTek `0c76:1203`
dongle fails to on the 7″ ROADOM when that display is powered through the Pi's USB;
full diagnosis in the project build notes, real fix is GPIO
5V power). So `picadeinstall` installs this selector on **every** build (not just
`--usb-audio`). This oneshot service runs once at boot, **before** EmulationStation,
and writes `/etc/asound.conf` to whatever's actually available:

- USB card present (`aplay -l` shows `WaveshareUSB`) → default to it (`dmix` so
  apps share it).
- Otherwise → default to the **connected HDMI** output (maps DRM `HDMI-A-1` →
  `vc4hdmi0`, `HDMI-A-2` → `vc4hdmi1`).

So you always get sound — USB when it came up, panel speakers when it didn't.

```bash
sudo cp setup/select-default-audio.sh      /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp setup/select-default-audio.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/select-default-audio.sh
sudo systemctl enable --now select-default-audio.service
journalctl -t select-default-audio         # shows which output it picked
```

> Pairs with the naming rule in §2 — the selector greps for the name
> `WaveshareUSB`, so install them together (the rule is what creates that name).

### 2b. Mask `fluidsynth` so it can't steal the audio device

**Why:** `fluidsynth` (a software MIDI synth) ships a **per-user systemd service**
that auto-starts at login and opens the ALSA default device **exclusively**. It
gets pulled in as a dependency by some emulators/ports (e.g. **gzdoom**) when you
install them through RetroPie-Setup. On the **HDMI audio path** our `asound.conf`
is `plughw`+`softvol` (not `dmix` — dmix won't initialize on the vc4 HDMI device),
so whoever opens it first owns it. If fluidsynth wins at boot, EmulationStation
and every game get **"Device or resource busy" → no sound** (USB/dmix boxes hide
this; exclusive-HDMI boxes go silent). `picadeinstall` masks it for you;
to do it by hand:

```bash
# global = applies to every user, and even if fluidsynth is installed later
sudo systemctl --global mask fluidsynth.service
# diagnose a "no sound" box: this shows if fluidsynth is holding the device
sudo fuser -v /dev/snd/*
```

> It's the per-*user* unit, so `systemctl --user` / `--global` — **not** plain
> `systemctl disable` (there is no system-level `fluidsynth.service`).

## 3. WiFi reliability on a mesh / eero network

The Pi 5's onboard `brcmfmac` WiFi intermittently **fails its initial
association** with mesh networks (eero, Google WiFi) — 802.11 `status_code=16`
(auth timeout). Symptom: the box boots fine into EmulationStation but `wlan0`
has **no IP**, ~half the time. A manual reconnect always works. Three layers:

> **Bigger picture — the onboard WiFi is fine for light use, not for sustained
> load.** The Pi 5's WiFi chip (Broadcom CYW43455) talks to the SoC over an
> **SDIO bus** that becomes unreliable under sustained throughput. Two failure
> modes seen in the field: (1) **SDIO halt** under a long *transmit* (e.g. a
> multi-GB file copy) — `brcmf_sdio_txfail` → *"failed backplane access over
> SDIO, halting operation"* — the radio stays associated but moves ~0 data until
> a reboot; (2) **degraded RX** (often after a kernel update) — sees only a few
> APs, can't see its own, no errors logged. Neither is power/heat (`vcgencmd
> get_throttled` = `0x0`). The watchdog (3c) and `disable-bt` help, but the only
> *cure* for a box that must stay reliable under load is to **bypass the onboard
> WiFi**: a **USB WiFi adapter** (e.g. a TP-Link Archer, driver `rtw88_8821au`)
> or **wired Ethernet**. A USB adapter on the reference master box took a 79 GB
> transfer with **0 drops** vs **554** on the onboard radio. Optional extra
> mitigation since these cabinets don't use Bluetooth: `dtoverlay=disable-bt` in
> `/boot/firmware/config.txt` frees the WiFi/BT shared resources on the chip.

### 3a. `brcmfmac.conf` — disable firmware roaming

```bash
sudo cp setup/brcmfmac.conf /etc/modprobe.d/
# takes effect on next reboot (module reload)
```

### 3b. NetworkManager connection settings

Tune the connection profile (named `RetroPie-WiFi` on the reference box —
substitute your profile name from `nmcli connection show`):

```bash
CON="RetroPie-WiFi"
# Empirically this Pi + eero associates on 5 GHz and gets rejected on 2.4 GHz,
# so pin 5 GHz. (Use 'bg' for 2.4 GHz if YOUR setup is the reverse — check the
# journal for which band actually completes association.)
sudo nmcli connection modify "$CON" 802-11-wireless.band a
sudo nmcli connection modify "$CON" 802-11-wireless.powersave 2          # disable power save
sudo nmcli connection modify "$CON" connection.autoconnect-retries 0     # retry forever
```

Make sure the PSK is **system-owned** (`psk-flags: 0`) so it's available at boot
without a logged-in user:

```bash
sudo nmcli -g 802-11-wireless-security.psk-flags connection show "$CON"   # want 0
```

### 3c. `wifi-watchdog` — the safety net (on by default; self-disabling)

Even with the above, association still misses some boots. The watchdog runs the
same recovery you'd do by hand — reconnect → bounce the radio — until it's
online, then idles. On the reference box it brings every boot online within
~20–80 s, unattended.

> **Note (2026-06-15): the watchdog no longer reloads the `brcmfmac` driver.**
> It used to escalate to `modprobe -r brcmfmac && modprobe brcmfmac` as a last
> resort. That step was removed because it is both ineffective and risky:
> in practice the unload almost always fails with *"Module brcmfmac is in use"*
> (NetworkManager holds the netdev open), so it does nothing; and on the rare
> occasion it *does* unload, reloading at a bad moment can leave the onboard
> chip **half-wedged — interface present and firmware loaded, but RX effectively
> deaf** (can't see/join its own AP) until a **cold power-cycle** (a soft reboot
> won't re-init it). Reconnect + radio bounce are the safe recoveries.

It is **safe to install on every build**, so `picadeinstall` enables it by
default (skip with `--no-watchdog`). It's **self-disabling**: "online" means a
global IPv4 on **any physical** interface (eth0, wlan0, wlan1, USB `wlx…` — anything
with a `/sys/class/net/<if>/device`), so on Ethernet or healthy WiFi it just idles.
Virtual interfaces (`docker0`, `br-*`, `veth*`, `tailscale0`, …) are **ignored** —
they keep their IPv4 while the box is offline, and counting them would make any
box running Docker or Tailscale look permanently online, so the watchdog would
never fire. It only ever acts when no physical interface has an IP — and then it
cycles through **every** WiFi device by name discovery (onboard + any USB adapter),
so there's nothing to hardcode or edit. (This is the rewrite — no `CON`/`IFACE` to
tune.)

It also recovers a **udev/NetworkManager race** seen after power events: the WiFi
device comes up `unmanaged (reason 'unmanaged-link-not-init')` and NM never tries
to connect it (a plain `nmcli device connect` just errors). Before each connect the
watchdog checks for an `unmanaged` device and runs `nmcli device set <dev> managed
yes` first.

```bash
sudo install -m 755 setup/wifi-watchdog.sh      /usr/local/bin/wifi-watchdog.sh
sudo install -m 644 setup/wifi-watchdog.service  /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now wifi-watchdog.service
journalctl -u wifi-watchdog.service -f           # watch it work
tail -f /var/log/wifi-watchdog.log
```

> Note: `--no-boot-tweaks` and `--no-watchdog` in `picadeinstall` cover 3c–3e
> together (the watchdog plus disabling `wait-online`/`nmbd`); the manual steps
> below are the same actions if you'd rather apply them piecemeal.

### 3d. Don't block boot waiting for WiFi

When WiFi fails to associate at boot, `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` stalls
the boot until its timeout (~100 s) — which delays `multi-user.target` and
everything ordered after it, including `ledcontrol.service` (so the **LED strip
stays dark ~100 s**). Nothing on an arcade box needs to block boot on network —
the watchdog (3c) brings WiFi up asynchronously — so disable it:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

Boot then proceeds immediately, WiFi connects in the background whenever it
manages to.

### 3e. Disable Samba `nmbd` (90 s boot timeout with no network)

`nmbd.service` (Samba's NetBIOS name daemon) takes **~90 s** to time out at boot
when WiFi isn't up yet, and it sits in the chain to `multi-user.target` — so it
slows the *entire* boot. `nmbd` only provides legacy "Network Neighborhood"
browsing; `smbd` (the actual file server) keeps working via `<host>.local`
(mDNS) or IP. Disable it:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nmbd        # smbd stays enabled
```

> Note: even with the above, the **LED strip** is kept fast at boot by
> decoupling `ledcontrol.service` from the network chain
> (`After=basic.target`, not `network.target`/`multi-user.target`) — see
> `ledcontrol.service` in the repo root. Without that, any slow unit in the
> `multi-user.target` chain leaves the strip dark until it clears.

## Notes

- These are **box/OS** concerns, separate from the LED controller software
  (`install.sh`). They live here because every Pi in the fleet needs them, and
  the release/build doc walks through them.
- The reference box runs RetroPie on Raspberry Pi OS **Trixie / Debian 13, Lite**, Pi 5.
- Verify any service/boot fix by **rebooting**, not just restarting — boot is
  the path that actually matters, and it guarantees a clean process table.
