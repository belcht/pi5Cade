# Arcade Build Guide

Building a Raspberry Pi 5 arcade cabinet running RetroPie, with reliable USB
audio and WS2812B LED lighting.

> This guide is intentionally **light on the generic steps** (flashing the OS,
> the stock RetroPie install — those are well documented elsewhere and change
> over time) and **deep on the parts specific to this build**: the recommended
> hardware, the audio + LED setup, and the box hardening that makes it boot fast
> and run reliably.

## Step 1 — Reach your Pi and log in

At this point you've flashed Raspberry Pi OS, booted the Pi, and it has joined
your network. Before anything else, confirm you can reach it and log in over SSH
from your computer.

> **SSH must be enabled on the Pi.** The easiest way is in **Raspberry Pi
> Imager** before flashing: click the gear/⚙ (advanced options) and *Enable SSH*,
> set the **username + password**, and (optionally) the **hostname**. If you
> didn't, enable it on the Pi itself with `sudo raspi-config` →
> *Interface Options → SSH*.

Throughout this guide, substitute your own values:
- **`<host>`** — the Pi's hostname you set in the imager, e.g. `picade` (reachable as `picade.local`)
- **`<user>`** — the username you set in the imager, e.g. `pi`

### 1a. Is the Pi reachable on the network?

```bash
ping <host>.local           # e.g. ping picade.local
```

You want replies like `64 bytes from 192.168.x.x ...`. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop.

- **If `ping` can't resolve `<host>.local`** (common on some Windows setups, or
  if mDNS is flaky), find the Pi's IP address instead — check your router's
  device list, or the Raspberry Pi Imager hostname you set — and use that IP in
  place of `<host>.local` everywhere below.

### 1b. Log in over SSH (first time, with your password)

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>.local     # e.g. ssh pi@picade.local
```

- The **first** connection asks to trust the Pi's identity:
  `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?` —
  type **`yes`** and press Enter. (This is normal and only happens once per Pi.)
- Enter the **password** you set in the imager when prompted.
- Success looks like a new prompt such as `pi@picade:~ $`. You're now on the Pi.

A successful first login looks like this:

```text
$ ssh pi@picade.local
pi@picade.local's password:
Linux Picade 6.12.75+rpt-rpi-2712 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian ... aarch64

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
...
Last login: Wed Jun 10 09:14:32 2026 from 192.168.x.x
pi@Picade:~ $
```

Type `exit` (or `Ctrl-D`) to return to your own computer.

**Troubleshooting**
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Could not resolve hostname <host>.local` | Use the Pi's IP address instead (see 1a). |
| `Connection refused` | SSH isn't enabled on the Pi — enable it (see the note above) and reboot. |
| `Permission denied (...password)` | Wrong username or password. The username is what you set in the imager, not necessarily `pi`. |

Once you can log in with your password, you have everything you need. The next
step just makes future logins effortless — it's **optional**.

---

## Step 2 — (Optional) Passwordless login with an SSH key

This saves you from typing the Pi's password every time, and is required if you
want to automate or script anything against the Pi. It's a one-time setup that
copies a small public "key" from your computer to the Pi. **Skip this if you'll
only ever work at the cabinet directly.**

> Run these on **your computer**, not on the Pi.

### 2a. Do you already have an SSH key?

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub        # macOS / Linux
# Windows (PowerShell):  dir $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
```

- **If it prints a path** — you already have a key, skip to **2c**.
- **If it says "No such file"** — make one in **2b**.

### 2b. Create a key (only if you don't have one)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "arcade"
```

- Press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- It asks for a passphrase. For a fully hands-off login, press **Enter** twice
  to leave it empty. (A passphrase is more secure but you'll be asked for it —
  not the Pi's password — on use.)

### 2c. Copy your key to the Pi

**macOS / Linux (easiest):**
```bash
ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>.local        # e.g. ssh-copy-id pi@picade.local
```
Enter the Pi's password **one last time**. Done.

**If `ssh-copy-id` isn't available** (or on Windows PowerShell), do it manually —
this appends your public key to the Pi's authorized list:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh <user>@<host>.local \
  "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh <user>@<host>.local "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
(Enter the Pi's password once when prompted.)

### 2d. Test it

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>.local
```

It should drop you straight to the Pi's prompt **with no password**. That's it —
passwordless login is set up.

---

## Step 3 — Passwordless `sudo`

> **Required if you'll run the installer unattended or over SSH** (e.g. driving it
> from another machine, or any detached/scripted run) — a background install can't
> stop to type a password. If you'll run the installer **by hand at the cabinet**,
> this is optional: `sudo ./picadeinstall.sh` just prompts for your password once.

On a fresh **Desktop** image, the user you created needs to type a password for
`sudo`. (The RetroPie SD image and the Lite-based setups already have passwordless
`sudo`; the Desktop image just doesn't.)

To enable it, run these **two commands** on the Pi (you'll enter your password
once, for the first one):

```bash
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/010-nopasswd-$USER
```
```bash
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/010-nopasswd-$USER
```

After this, `sudo` no longer prompts for a password.

---

## Step 4 — Update the system and firmware

Bring the freshly-imaged OS fully up to date *before* installing anything else.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

> Use **`full-upgrade`**, not `upgrade` — a fresh image often needs dependency
> changes that plain `upgrade` won't do. On this build it pulled ~227 packages,
> including a newer kernel.

Update the Raspberry Pi 5 bootloader/firmware:

```bash
sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
```

Confirm your locale is valid — RetroPie's installer scripts fail on a broken one:

```bash
locale
```

You want a `LANG=…UTF-8` line set and **no** "cannot set locale" warnings. The
imager's default (e.g. `en_GB.UTF-8` or `en_US.UTF-8`) is fine as-is. To change
it: `sudo raspi-config` → *Localisation Options → Locale*.

Reboot to load the new kernel and apply the firmware:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

When it comes back, confirm the update took:

```bash
uname -r                 # should show the new kernel
sudo rpi-eeprom-update   # CURRENT firmware date should be recent
```

> **On WiFi?** If your Pi is on WiFi and it comes back *without* an IP after a
> reboot (you can reach the desktop but not SSH), you may be hitting an
> association issue common on mesh networks (e.g. eero) — see the **optional
> WiFi reliability** section later. On a wired connection this won't happen.

---

## Step 5 — Install everything with `picadeinstall`

From here, one script installs RetroPie, the LED controller, the box hardening,
and (optionally) USB audio.

> **Prefer to do every step by hand?** See **[MANUAL-INSTALL.md](MANUAL-INSTALL.md)**
> — it walks through the same RetroPie install, hardening, audio, and LED setup
> manually, so you can follow and adapt each step without the script.

Clone the repo and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/belcht/pi5Cade.git
cd pi5Cade
sudo ./picadeinstall.sh
```

> Needs `sudo`. Running it by hand prompts for your password once; running it
> **unattended or over SSH requires passwordless `sudo`** (see Step 3).

It prompts for the one thing that's truly per-cabinet — **how many LEDs** are in
your strip — and otherwise uses sensible defaults. On a fresh box this does the
full install:

- **RetroPie** (Core + Main packages) and boot-to-EmulationStation.
- **LED controller** — the WS2812B software and its `ledcontrol.service`.
- **Box hardening (on by default):** persistent logging (`journald`), boot-speed
  tweaks (disabling `systemd-networkd-wait-online` and `nmbd`), and a
  self-disabling WiFi watchdog.

### Options

```text
--leds N          number of WS2812B LEDs (prompted if omitted)
--auto            non-interactive (needs --leds); use defaults, no prompts
--update          re-apply ONLY the LED software + audio + watchdog (fast, safe)
--reset           full install AND reset ledcontrol.toml to defaults
--no-usb-audio    don't install the USB sound-card naming rule (default installs
                  it; it auto-prefers the dongle when present — see Step 6)
--keep-pipewire   don't mask PipeWire (default masks it on desktop images so the
                  RetroPie/ES volume control works — see Step 6)
--usbromservice   RetroPie USB ROM service (load ROMs from a USB stick)
--samba           RetroPie Samba ROM shares (load ROMs over the network)
--no-upgrade      skip 'apt full-upgrade' (you did it in Step 4)
--no-retropie     skip the RetroPie install
--no-autostart    don't boot straight into EmulationStation
--no-journald / --no-boot-tweaks / --no-watchdog   skip a hardening piece
```

### Re-running it later

The script is **idempotent** — safe to run again. It manages its own
marker-bounded blocks in `config.txt`/`cmdline.txt` (rewritten, not duplicated),
and it **never touches your config, ROMs, or saves** unless you pass `--reset`.

For routine "pull the latest LED software" updates, use **`--update`**: it
re-applies only the LED controller, audio selector, and watchdog — fast, and it
doesn't touch the OS or RetroPie.

After a successful full install it records the kernel and RetroPie versions. If
you later run a **full** install again and those have moved on (a kernel update,
etc.), it **warns you and offers to drop to `--update`** instead — so a routine
re-run can't surprise you by rebuilding on top of a changed system.

---

## Step 6 — Audio

**Audio is automatic — you don't choose a mode.** `picadeinstall` installs a
boot-time **audio selector** plus the USB sound-card **naming rule** on every
build, and at each boot it picks the right output for whatever's plugged in:

- **USB sound card present** → it's the default (louder/clearer; recommended ~$25
  upgrade — the dongle in the BOM).
- **No USB sound card** → the **connected HDMI** (the selector detects whichever
  HDMI port the monitor is on, so it works on HDMI0 *or* HDMI1 — no silent-card-0
  surprise).

So plugging the USB dongle in — now or later — "just works," and pulling it out
falls back to HDMI. No flag needed. (The naming rule is harmless without a
dongle: it only matches the dongle's USB ID.)

> Don't want USB audio even with a dongle plugged in? Install with
> **`--no-usb-audio`** and the default stays on HDMI.

**Volume control** also works automatically — the installer points
EmulationStation's volume slider at the right mixer (`Speaker` for the USB card;
a software control for HDMI, which has no hardware volume of its own).

> **If you imaged a *desktop* Raspberry Pi OS**, it runs **PipeWire**, which hijacks
> audio so RetroPie's volume control can't work (the RetroPie audio menu even says
> "pulseaudio is running"). `picadeinstall` handles this by **masking PipeWire**
> (reversible, removes no packages — `--keep-pipewire` to skip). **Better: use the
> RetroPie image or RPi OS Lite**, which has no sound server and avoids the whole
> issue. See the project build notes.

### Advanced: USB sound card on the 7″ ROADOM panel

The 7″ ROADOM has a quirk: **powering it through the Pi's USB port stops the USB
sound card from enumerating at boot** (a cold-start USB conflict — see
the project build notes for the full diagnosis). The fix is to **power
the display from the Pi's GPIO 5V rail** (header **pin 2 or 4 = 5V**, **pin 6 =
GND**; the ROADOM ships a cable for this) and run HDMI to the Pi. Then the
monitor's power never touches USB and the sound card enumerates cleanly.

If powering both the display **and** the LED strip from GPIO 5V is too much for
the rail, move the **LED strip's 5V/GND to a USB port** (keep its data wire on
GPIO 10). That's safe: the strip is dark at boot and only draws current once the
LED controller lights it a few seconds in — well after audio has come up.
